# Drop Legacy JavaEE

- Camunda 7 code base is bound to JavaEE API (javax namespace)
- JakartaEE API provided by build-time transformations
- JavaEE dependency implied multiple dependencies on outdated libraries
- Support of legacy containers (Tomcat 9, Wildfly 26) and build time transformations made the build complex

- 12k issues resolved
- ~50% resolved with help of OpenRewrite
