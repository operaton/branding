# Why is Operaton the best BPM engine for the next decade?

- Free Open Source (not only open core)
  - No vendor lock-in
  - Flexible usage without restrictions
  - Up-to-date technology stack
  - Driven by a strong community with passion
  - Growing ecosystem of applications, tools and service providers

---

# Why prefer Operaton over Camunda 8?

- No vendor lock-in
  - Camunda 8 is _very_ expensive
  - Not embeddable
  - Not transactional
  - Not feature complete

---

# How to ensure long-term sustainability?

- Support contract with Service Provider
  - Sponsor development of required features
  - Contribute yourself
  - The project needs paid FTEs

---

- Shout out to Camunda for providing a great code base üôè
- Thanks to all contributors and supporters
